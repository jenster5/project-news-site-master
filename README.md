# News Site

My assignment is to create a newspaper or magazine site that is compatible for computers, tablets and phones. Depending on the device in use the reader should see a variety of news stories.  The ability to offer a variety of clickable options should increase readership. 
 
## The problem
I started with the HTML and tried to structure it the best way possible to help me logically approach the CSS. I started with adding the news stories text images and hyperlinks. I first thought it would be easist to use grid to place all of my features but after trying that for a few hours I started using flexbox and that seemed to work better for some reason. 

If I had more time I would use this code as a framework and try to rewrite it in the simplest way possible. I started with desktop first and this was a mistake as I didnt follow the videos instructions so when I tried to make it resposive afterward it was a bit of a mess. I spent most of my time on this and it still is not how I would like it to be unfortunatly. 


## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
